# SuperuserKAM - Terminal Theme

![kam_superuser header](assets/Header.gif)

This color scheme was created to match with the `SuperuserKAM` keycap design by [FreshFromTheGrave](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=108326.0%3Futm_source%3Dkeycapsets) and should give you the possibility to configure your terminal accordingly.
